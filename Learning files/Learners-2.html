            <p class="First-paragraph">In the gospel of mark, we read of a woman who had been unwell for 12years. Some-one told her about Jesus.So, when he came through her own , she sat on the side of te road, waiting. As He passed by, she reached out quietly to touch the hem of His robe.</p>
            <p>She wsa immediately healed. But she was'nt the only one who notced that miracle; jesus did too. &quot;And jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned im about in the press, and said, who touched my clothes&quest;&quot;(Mark 5:30). Virtue can also mean strenght. jesus immediately knew someone had recieved strenght from him. Hus reaction was to find her, to talk to her, to remind her of the power of faith. He called her &quot;daughter&quot;. Through him , she was made whole. </p>
            <p>I have learned that a prayer for strenght never goes unanswered. If we reach out to Hi, he &quot;reaches our reaching&quot;(see <span class="italics-text">Hymns</span> no. 129). Each article in this month's magazine is a remainder of that truth.</p>

            <p>In<span class="italics-text">For The Strenght of The Youth:</span>A Guide For Making Choices, the First Presidency teaches that &quot;the savior ... is the 'strenght or the youth'&quot;(&lbrack;2022&rbrack;, 2). Perhaps you wonder how to acess that strenght. It is my hope that you will find something within these pages that will lead you to reach for Him.</p>
            <p>Search these pages. Look for the words of hope, find a scripture of strenght, write down promtings that have left  an impression on your heart. Through Jesus Christ, you will also be made whole. </p>
