        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="text">Threee months after the church organized the lord , through the prophet Joseph Smith instructed Joseph's wife, Emma, to make a selection of sacred hymns of te church: "For my soul delighted in the songs of the heart; yea, yae songs the songs of the rihteous is prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their head" (D&C 25:12).</p>
        <p class="text">Now, 150 years after the first hymnbook was published by the church, we are pleased to present this revision. Many hymns found in our original hymnbook and in subsequent aditions are included, as a number of newlyadded hymns. All heave been selected to meet the varied needs of today's worldwide Church membership.</p>

        <h1>Music in Our Church Meetings </h1>
        <p>Inspirational music is an essential part of our church meetings. The hymns invite the spirit of the lord, create a feeling of reverence, unify us as members, and provide a way for us to offer praises to yhe lord.</p>
        <p>Some of the greatest sermons are preached by the singing of hymns. Hymns move us to repentance and good works, build testimony and faith, comfort the weary, console the mourning, and inspire us to the end.</p>
        <p>We hope to see an increase of hymn singing in our congregations. We encourage all members, whether musically inclined or not, to join with us in singing the hymns. We hope leaders, teachers, and members who are called on to speak will turn often to the hymnbook to find sermons presented powerfully and beautifully in verse.</p>
